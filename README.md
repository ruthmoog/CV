## Ruth Baker
**Software developer.**

I want to use technology to positively impact the lives of users, and work with fantastic people to achieve our goals & maintain great software.

### About me

After working in science publishing for a decade I decided to change career; I chose to work directly with technology, be a driver for digital innovation: to be a software developer.
I was accepted on the Makers Academy fellowship program in May 2019.

I'd love to work somewhere that,
 - Invests in the growth of developers _and_ technology
 - Fosters openness, diversity and, flexibility

<!-- #### Problem solving

<details><summary>Able to create scalable solutions to time-boxed problems</summary><p>

At _Springer Nature_ I developed a strategy for GDPR compliance on journals which were not meeting minimum requirements. To do this I collaborated with colleagues to investigate issues and generate potential solutions. I prioritised effective and achievable ideas to make all journals compliant with minimal disruption and to deadline.

<details><summary>Investigate the root cause</summary><p>

When coding with others I've been told my tenacity when getting to the bottom of errors is to be admired!  If a test passes but the results don't look quite right, I want to know why.

At _Springer Nature_ I was tasked with introducing a check in production to avoid publishing manuscripts with censoring errors.  When I looked into the cause, the users were not given censoring instructions and were making mistakes.  In addition, the user community had more complex censoring needs than anticipated.  As well as providing up-to-date instructions, I was able to introduce a check prior to production. This targeted only _relevant_ manuscripts without impacting production workload, whilst saving time and heartache for the users.

<!-- #### Accuracy -->

<!-- <details><summary>Good at spotting typographical errors</summary><p>

I look out for errors and am good at spotting them.  This attention to detail was a requirement of my job in print production at _Springer Healthcare_.  I was responsible for approving proofs of print books and conference materials.  In my roles at _BMC_ I would write and check online copy, and was called upon for proof-reading copy and HTML in my department.  It's a useful skill for writing code!

</p></details>
<details><summary>Proactive approach to corrections</summary><p>

I am happy to make editorial suggestions and have used pull requests to improve document or code quality; like in the [codebar tutorials](https://github.com/ruthmoog/tutorials/commits?author=ruthmoog); or the [Odin Project curriculum](https://github.com/ruthmoog/curriculum/commits?author=ruthmoog).

#### Quick learner -->

<details><summary>Growth mindset and will to learn</summary><p>

In being selected for _Makers_ I can say that they agree with this!  I take an organised approach to learning and consider where I focus.  Changing my career demonstrates my determination to continue learning and to improve at programming for the long-term.

</p></details>
<details><summary>Proactive approach to learning</summary><p>

I enjoy learning and have become good better at identifying where I can improve.  I was struggling to limit my side-projects and was frustrated that as a result I wasn't delivering as quickly as I wanted.  I used the opportunity to learn Kanban, by reading up and watching a talk by Eric Brechner, then, I used personal Kanban to manage my side-projects with Trello.  Kaban helped me focus, work with clear deliverables, and lessen the cognitive load by reframing a long list of incomplete tasks as backlog.

<!-- Use retrospectives and feedback to spot opportunity -->

<!-- #### Collaboration

 - worked as a line manager, volunteered as a teacher and mentor sensitive to the experience of others, able to explain complex ideas or describe ideas in a new way.
 - Pair programming with colleagues and more experienced peers and share rewards across the team -->

## Education
