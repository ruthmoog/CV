  | Project Info | Skills | Stack | Links |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **Hello, Portfolio**<br />personal static page website | Built with `semantic HTML` and with `accessibility` in mind.  I created `wireframes` of the site design and used `CSS grid` to make a `responsive` single-page website.  | `HTML` `CSS` `Heroku` | [GitHub](https://github.com/ruthmoog/portfolio)<br />[ruthmoog.dev](https://www.ruthmoog.dev) |
| **Checkboxer**<br />text generator tool | A `responsive` tool that solves a `real world` problem by generating custom text templates.  The user selects options in a `HTML checklist` form and their input generates specific text to match their requests, by reading from a locally configured `CSV` file. The live demo is set up with `continuous delivery` automatically deploying to production. | `Sinatra` `Heroku` `Travis CI` `Ruby` `eRuby` `CSS` `HTML` `RSpec` `Capybara` `Rubocop` `RubyCritic` `SimpleCov` | [GitHub](https://github.com/ruthmoog/checkboxer)<br />[live demo](https://checkboxer.herokuapp.com/) |
| **Fizzy-O**<br /> <strong>final project</strong><br />exercise tracking mobile app | Developed in a `team` with a `scrum` agile process (managed through `Trello`), `pair-programming` and `XP values`.  We used `semantic commits` and feature branching, and we created team member user manuals | `React Native` `JSX` `Expo` `XCode` `Prettier` `Jest` `Enzyme` `iOS` `Android OS` | [Github](https://github.com/LucyMHall/Fizzy_O/commits?author=ruthmoog) |

## Skills

**Growth mindset: quick to learn**

I take an organised and efficient approach to learning.  My determination to continue learning and to improve as a developer for the long-term is evident in my career-change and self-directed education at Makers Academy.  I was able to code a web app in `JavaScript` in 1 week without having used the language before, and from there, TDD a kata by writing the tests in pure JS - Pretty neat! (middle char)

**Development process: BDD, TDD, CI/CD**

Throughout the course I've written unit tests and feature tests to drive development incrementally and from the outside in, with testing DSLs `RSpec`, `Jasmine` and `Capybara` following the mantra "red, green, refactor".  Tools like `Travis` and `Heroku` have enabled CI & CD.  On my [personal website](https://ruthmoog.dev) project I used the `lighthouse` audit to create a website that achieved scores of 100% for performance, accessibility, SEO and best practices.

**Agile practises: scrum, kanban**

I was struggling to limit my side-projects and was frustrated that as a result I wasn't delivering as quickly as I wanted.  I used the opportunity to learn Kanban, by reading up and watching a talk by Eric Brechner, then, I used personal Kanban to manage my side-projects with `Trello`.  Kaban helped me focus, work with clear deliverables, and lessen the cognitive load by reframing a long list of incomplete tasks as backlog.  At Makers, I worked with in teams using Kanban ([Seagull BnB](https://github.com/ruthmoog/Seagull-BnB/commits?author=ruthmoog)) and Scrum ([Acebook](https://github.com/bengscott2/acebook-livewire/commits?author=ruthmoog)) where I got to lead `retros`, `stand-ups`, and `sprint-planning`.  I estimated story points and tracked our velocity.

**Enthusiastic collaborator: XP values, team work, & pair programming**

For me pair programming is the norm!  I've had the privilege of pairing with amazing people in my cohort, communicating actively and with kindness.  I've reflected at times when pairing didn't go well, using the opportunity to give and receive feedback, try new approaches, and become a better pair partner - with wonderful feedback from my peers!

> "A wonderful pair partner"

>"Very patient and supportive"

>"Keep working in the same way, you rock!"
