## Ruth Baker
**Full stack Ruby developer.**

I want to further technology, positively impact the lives of users, and work with fantastic people to achieve our goals & maintain great software.

### About me

After working in science publishing for a decade I decided to change career; I chose to work directly with technology, be a driver for digital innovation: to be a software developer.
I was accepted on the Makers Academy fellowship program in May 2019.

I'd love to work somewhere that,
 - Invests in the growth of developers _and_ technology
 - Fosters openness, diversity and, flexibility

## Skills

#### Problem solving

<details><summary>**Able to create scalable solutions to time-boxed problems.**</summary> At Springer Nature I developed a strategy for GDPR compliance on journals which were note meeting out minimum requirements. To do this I collaborated with colleagues to investigate what issues needed to be corrected and generate potential solutions. I prioritised the most effective and achievable ideas in order to make all journals compliant by the legal deadline with the least disruption.</details>
<details><summary>**Investigate the root cause**.</summary>People I've coded with have told me they respect my tenacity when getting to the bottom of errors, if a test passes but the result doesn't look quite right, I want to know why.  At Springer Nature I was tasked with introducing a check in production to avoid publishing manuscripts with censoring errors.  When I looked into this, the errors were caused because users did not have instructions on how to censor their manuscript.  In addition we could introduce an check prior to production on only _relevant_ manuscripts without impacting production workload whilst saving a lot of time and heartache for the users.</details>

<!-- Break problems into smaller parts -->

#### Accuracy

<details><summary>**Good at spotting typographical errors**</summary>I look out for errors and am good at spotting them.  This attention to detail was a requirement of my job in print production at Springer Healthcare, where I was responsible for approving proofs of print books and conference materials.  In my roles at BMC I would write and check online copy, and was called upon for proof-reading and checking HTML in my department.  It's a useful skill for writing code!</details>
<details><summary>**Proactive approach to corrections**</summary>I am happy to make editorial suggestions and have used pull requests to improve document or code quality; like in the [codebar tutorials](https://github.com/ruthmoog/tutorials/commits?author=ruthmoog); or the [Odin Project curriculum](https://github.com/ruthmoog/curriculum/commits?author=ruthmoog)</details>

#### Quick learner

<details><summary>**Growth mindset and will to learn**</summary>In being selected for Makers I can say that they agree with this!  I take an organised approach to my learning and I consider where I focus my learning.  By changing my career I've demonstrated my determination to continue learning how to improve at programming.</details>
<details><summary>**Proactive approach to learning**</summary>I enjoy learning through online courses, workshops, classes and coaching.  I can identifying gaps in knowledge and where I can improve.  As an example, I was struggling to limit the projects I was working on and was frustrated that as a result I wasn't delivering what I wanted.  I learned about Kanban to solve this problem and to help become familiar with the process.  I read up, and watched a talk by Eric Brechner, then used personal Kanban to manage my projects with Trello - Kaban helped me focus on only what I had prioritised, break down topics into clear deliverables, and lessened the cognitive load by reframing a long list of incomplete tasks as backlog.</details>

<!-- #### Collaboration

 - worked as a line manager, volunteered as a teacher and mentor sensitive to the experience of others, able to explain complex ideas or describe ideas in a new way.
 - Pair programming with colleagues and more experienced peers and share rewards across the team -->

## Education
