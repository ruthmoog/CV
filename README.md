## Ruth Baker

After working in science publishing for a decade I decided to change my career; I choose to work directly with technology, be a driver for digital innovation: to be a software developer.  I focussed on learning coding foundations, and was accepted on the Makers Academy fellowship program in May 2019.

At Makers I have been developing coding knowledge, using best-practises, & learning industry-standard software engineering methods - You can take a look at some examples of my work on Github!

### What am I Looking For?
I want to further technology, positively impact the lives of users, and work with fantastic people to achieve our goals & maintain great software.
I'd love to work somewhere that,
 - Invests in the growth of it's developers as well as technology
 - Fosters an ethos of openess and adaptability
 - Doesn't want to be scared of pushing code on Fridays
