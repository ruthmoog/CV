## Skills

**Growth mindset: quick to learn**

I take an organised and efficient approach to learning.  My determination to continue learning and to improve as a developer for the long-term is evident in my career-change and self-directed education at Makers Academy.  I was able to code in `JavaScript` and after 1 week TDD a kata writing tests in pure JS - Pretty neat! (middle char)

**Development process: BDD, TDD, CI/CD**

Throughout the course I've written unit tests and feature tests to drive development incrementally and from the outside in with testing DSLs `RSpec`, `Jasmine` and `Capybara` following the mantra "red, green, refactor".  Tools like `Travis` and `Heroku` have enabled CI & CD.  On my [personal website](https://ruthmoog.dev) project I used the `lighthouse` audit to create website that achieved 100 scores for performance, accessibility, SEO and best practices.

**Agile practises: scrum, kanban**

I was struggling to limit my side-projects and was frustrated that as a result I wasn't delivering as quickly as I wanted.  I used the opportunity to learn Kanban, by reading up and watching a talk by Eric Brechner, then, I used personal Kanban to manage my side-projects with `Trello`.  Kaban helped me focus, work with clear deliverables, and lessen the cognitive load by reframing a long list of incomplete tasks as backlog.  At Makers, I worked with in teams using kanban ([Seagull BnB](https://github.com/ruthmoog/Seagull-BnB/commits?author=ruthmoog)) and scrum ([Acebook](https://github.com/bengscott2/acebook-livewire/commits?author=ruthmoog)) where I got to lead `retros`, `stand-ups`, and `sprint-planning`, where we estimated story points and tracked our team velocity.

**Enthusiastic collaborator: XP values, team work, & pair programming**

For me pair programming is the norm!  I've had the privilege of pairing with amazing people on my cohort, communicating actively and with kindness.  I've reflected at times when pairing didn't go well, using the opportunity to give and receive feedback, try new approaches, and become a better pair partner - with wonderful feedback from my peers!
> "A wonderful pair partner"

>"Very patient and supportive"

>"Keep working in the same way, you rock!"

## About me

I want to work directly with technology and be a driver of digital innovation.  I've been active in the coding community, attending meet-ups, keeping a blog and, as a moderator for codebars' virtual codebar.
I was accepted on the Makers Academy fellowship program in May 2019.

I'd love to work somewhere that,
 - Invests in the growth of developers _and_ technology
 - Fosters openness and diversity
